This error occurs because your local branch has commits that aren't on the remote branch, and the remote branch has commits that aren't on your local branch. Git doesn't know how you want to combine these divergent histories.
The Problem: Divergent Branches üåø
When you run git pull, Git tries to fetch changes from a remote repository and integrate them into your current local branch. A divergent branch happens when:
 * You've made new commits on your local branch (e.g., main).
 * Someone else has made new commits on the remote version of the same branch (e.g., origin/main).
Git can't perform a simple "fast-forward" merge, where it just moves the branch pointer forward, because there are two distinct lines of development. Instead, it needs explicit instructions on how to handle the merge.
How to Resolve the Issue üõ†Ô∏è
Git provides three main strategies for reconciling divergent branches, and you must choose one to resolve the error. You can set a default for future pulls or specify a strategy for a single pull.
1. Merge (The Default) ü§ù
This strategy combines the two histories into a single, new "merge commit."
 * Command: git pull --no-rebase or set the default with git config pull.rebase false.
 * How it works: Git creates a new commit that has two parents: the head of your local branch and the head of the remote branch. This preserves the exact history of both branches.
 * Pros: Keeps a clear, non-linear history that shows exactly when and where the merge occurred.
 * Cons: Can create extra merge commits that may "clutter" the commit history.
2. Rebase (A Cleaner History) ‚ôªÔ∏è
This strategy takes your local commits and reapplies them on top of the remote branch's commits.
 * Command: git pull --rebase or set the default with git config pull.rebase true.
 * How it works: Git temporarily stashes your local commits, fetches the remote changes, and then "replays" your commits one by one on top of the updated remote branch. This makes it look like you started your work from the latest version of the remote branch.
 * Pros: Creates a clean, linear history, making it easier to read and understand the project's progression.
 * Cons: Rewrites your commit history, which can be problematic if you have already pushed your commits to a public branch. You should generally avoid rebasing commits that others are working with.
3. Fast-Forward Only (The Safest) ‚è©
This strategy only allows a pull if it can be done with a simple fast-forward merge.
 * Command: git pull --ff-only or set the default with git config pull.ff only.
 * How it works: If your branch has diverged, this command will fail. It forces you to manually merge or rebase.
 * Pros: Prevents accidental merges or rebases and provides a clear signal that you must manually decide how to proceed. It's often used in strict workflows.
 * Cons: Fails when a divergence occurs, requiring an extra step to resolve.
How to Fix It Now
To resolve the error and pull the latest changes, choose one of the following commands:
 * To Merge: git pull origin <branch_name> --no-rebase
 * To Rebase: git pull origin <branch_name> --rebase
Replace <branch_name> with the name of the branch you are working on, such as main or develop. After running the command, your local branch will be updated with the remote changes.
