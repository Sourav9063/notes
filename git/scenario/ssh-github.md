You're seeing this error because GitHub no longer allows you to use your account password for Git operations on the command line as of August 13, 2021. This change was made to improve security.

Instead of your password, you now need to use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** or configure **SSH keys**.

-----

### Solution 1: Use a Personal Access Token (The Easier Method)

A Personal Access Token is a long, randomly generated string that you use in place of your password when authenticating to GitHub on the command line.

#### Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token

1.  Go to your GitHub **Settings**.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **Developer settings**.
3.  Click on **Personal access tokens**, and then select **Tokens (classic)**.
4.  Click **Generate new token**.
5.  Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "My Laptop CLI").
6.  Set an **expiration** for your token.
7.  Under **Select scopes**, check the `repo` box. This will grant the token permissions to access your repositories.
8.  Scroll to the bottom and click **Generate token**.

**Important:** Copy your new token immediately. You won't be able to see it again after you leave the page.

#### Step 2: Use the Token with Git

Now, when you run a Git command (like `git push` or `git clone`) and it asks for your password, paste the Personal Access Token you just copied.

It's often easier to update your remote URL to include the token so you don't have to enter it every time:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO>.git
```

Replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>`, `<YOUR_TOKEN>`, and `<YOUR_REPO>` with your actual details.

### Solution 2: Use an SSH Key (More Secure & Convenient)

This method involves creating a pair of cryptographic keys on your computer. You add the public key to your GitHub account, and the private key on your computer is used to authenticate you securely without needing a password or token for every push.

#### Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys

First, check if you already have SSH keys:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you see files named `id_rsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, or `id_ecdsa.pub`, you already have a key. You can skip to "Step 3".

#### Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key

If you don't have a key, generate one with this command, replacing `"your_email@example.com"` with your GitHub email address:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," just press **Enter** to accept the default location. You can optionally enter a passphrase for extra security.

#### Step 3: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

1.  Copy your public SSH key to your clipboard. The command below works for the recommended `ed25519` key:

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

2.  Go to your GitHub **Settings**.

3.  In the left sidebar, click on **SSH and GPG keys**.

4.  Click **New SSH key**.

5.  Give it a title (e.g., "My Laptop").

6.  Paste the key you copied into the "Key" field.

7.  Click **Add SSH key**.

#### Step 4: Use the SSH Remote URL

Finally, make sure your repository is configured to use the SSH URL instead of the HTTPS one. You can check this with `git remote -v`. If it shows an `https://` URL, change it with this command:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Sourav9063/config.git
```

Now, all your Git commands for this repository will use the secure SSH connection, and you won't need to enter a password or token.

Of course. When `ssh-keygen` prompts you with:

```
Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

Simply **type the full path and filename** where you'd like to save the key and then press **Enter**.

For example, if you want to save it in a folder named `CustomKeys` on your C: drive, you might type:

```
/c/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/CustomKeys/my_new_key
```

### Important Next Steps

Because you're not using the default location, you must manually tell your system's SSH agent where to find your key.

#### 1\. Start the SSH Agent

First, ensure the agent is running in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

You should see a message like `Agent pid 12345`.

#### 2\. Add Your Custom SSH Key

Now, add your key to the SSH agent using the **exact path** you specified earlier. This step "registers" the key for your current terminal session.

```bash
ssh-add /c/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/CustomKeys/my_new_key
```

After doing this, you'll be able to authenticate with GitHub using your new, custom-located key. You'll need to repeat the `ssh-add` command for each new terminal session.
